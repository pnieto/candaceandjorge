## Golden Gate Seaplane Tour

Take flight over one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World, the Golden Gate Bridge! Our most popular tour shares views of this iconic bridge and the San Francisco skyline.

#### The experience

Take off from the waters of Marin, the county connecting San Francisco to the rest of California via the Golden Gate Bridge. Soar through the gate to the San Francisco Bay on this iconic seaplane tour.

Peer below at the expansive Red arches of the bridge from an impeccably restored DeHaviland Beaver seaplane. Your pilot will retell history aligning with expansive views as your plane completes passes over and offshore the city, before a smooth landing back in Sausalitoâ€™s Richardson Bay.
